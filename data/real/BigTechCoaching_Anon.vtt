1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.909
Speaker A:   Cool. How's it going, Matt?

2
00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:12.980
Speaker B:   Good. Good to see you. Is this recording absolutely everything? Is it multimodal? Or is it just the audio transcript, you know.

3
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.939
Speaker A:   Multimodal. Okay. Cool.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.049
Speaker B:   Cause, then we can use it for other things too.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.100
Speaker A:   Yeah.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.689
Speaker B:   Good good to see you again. It's good to have you been since we met last.

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.380
Speaker A:   I'm doing well. I'm enjoying the the Bay Area weather.

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.570
Speaker A:   But there's yeah. My personal life is fine.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.660
Speaker A:   The work life is a little bit

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.670
Speaker A:   a little bit stressful, a little bit annoying. What about yourself?

11
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.247
Speaker A:   Yeah, about the same

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.429
Speaker B:   And let's let's go right into it. Let me make sure I'm clear. When we talked last it sounded like

13
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.210
Speaker B:   you've had a lot of hopes and dreams and ambitions, but

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.380
Speaker B:   feels a bit stalled and a bit blocked, and maybe not making all the progress you want. And you, if if you've

15
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.190
Speaker B:   if this coaching works for you, you want to feel like

16
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.529
Speaker B:   you're accelerating your path toward your toward a promotion, or at least having a better career trajectory am I? Am I understanding correctly kind of

17
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.380
Speaker B:   what you're hoping to get out of this relationship together?

18
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.900
Speaker A:   That's right. Yeah, I I'm focused on the promotion.

19
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:38.059
Speaker A:   not because not primarily because of the extra money and title or whatever, but really because it will give me more scope to do more ambitious and more interesting projects. Nice.

20
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.120
Speaker A:   you know, at our company we don't.

21
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.590
Speaker A:   If if you're not at a certain level they don't trust you to initiate.

22
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.779
Speaker A:   Sure pursue more ambitious projects.

23
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.370
Speaker B:   And maybe just say a word or 2 about that increased scope or that increased ambitious Ness. What? What?

24
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.729
Speaker B:   What does Linkedin consider that scope, and that ambition that you aspire to go do that kind of work that you're maybe not given permission to right now to say a few words about that for me.

25
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.460
Speaker A:   Yeah, I think, being more involved in the actual.

26
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.919
Speaker A:   real technical decisions, the architectural decisions.

27
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.030
Speaker A:   the big picture decisions, at least

28
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.160
Speaker A:   not the big big picture business decisions. But the big picture technical decisions

29
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.769
Speaker A:   that will guide our team towards the future make our team more efficient, make our team more valuable to the rest of the company.

30
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.130
Speaker B:   Nice makes sense, but.

31
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.300
Speaker A:   Cut down on our.

32
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.500
Speaker B:   So we have tons of operational problems that.

33
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.880
Speaker A:   Plague us, and I have tons. I have tons of ideas about how to fix those so.

34
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.550
Speaker B:   Nice.

35
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.750
Speaker A:   Get getting to a level where I can really push that forward, I think would be.

36
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.959
Speaker B:   No, it makes sense that that'd be exciting. I can see where that would be engaging for you. Let's maybe just talk about what your top

37
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.710
Speaker B:   2 or 3

38
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:16.009
Speaker B:   frustrations, or blockers or barriers to that kind of career progression that you're you're hoping for. What? What are your top? 3 that are really frustrating right now, at least. And are they the same as the last time we talked, or is it? Is it evolving.

39
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.240
Speaker A:   It's evolving. I I think maybe last time we talked

40
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.720
Speaker A:   I had a little bit of a rosier view, because

41
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.439
Speaker A:   this project was going a lot better, you know.

42
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.819
Speaker A:   Couple months ago we were doing

43
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.069
Speaker A:   seemed like we were making decent progress.

44
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.329
Speaker A:   whereas now it's really starting to the progress is really starting to grind down and grind to a halt.

45
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.160
Speaker B:   Because.

46
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.580
Speaker A:   Well.

47
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.300
Speaker B:   Why does it seem to be grinding down.

48
00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:59.279
Speaker A:   Yeah. There's a number of issues going on.

49
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.309
Speaker A:   I I don't like to point fingers, but my real assessment is that the main. The tech lead of the project

50
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.780
Speaker A:   is just not leading it. Well,

51
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.729
Speaker A:   that manifests in a couple different ways. One is that

52
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.720
Speaker A:   the you know, the most tangible

53
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.439
Speaker A:   annoyance is that he sits on my code reviews.

54
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.749
Speaker A:   So I'll write a piece of code.

55
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.700
Speaker A:   publish it, you know. Publish it for review, and then

56
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.889
Speaker A:   it'll take him a day or 2, or 3, or longer, sometimes to get back to me.

57
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.140
Speaker A:   Which which really means, I mean in theory, you could.

58
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.529
Speaker A:   you could be sort of doubling up like

59
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.299
Speaker A:   writing some code, publishing it, then switching over another piece and publishing that.

60
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.720
Speaker A:   But in practice that's really hard to do, and and often is inefficient.

61
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.519
Speaker A:   So so if if it takes me

62
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.360
Speaker A:   2 days to get a code review that mean, that's that puts a real high

63
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.320
Speaker A:   upper bound on my productivity. So you know a piece of code.

64
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.329
Speaker A:   The code might not take me that long to write. I'm a you know. I'm a pretty

65
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.000
Speaker A:   pretty solid engineer. A lot of this stuff is not super high concept.

66
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.030
Speaker A:   so maybe it takes 4Â h to write it.

67
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.080
Speaker A:   Then I publish it, and I wait 2 days so like, so like like

68
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.469
Speaker A:   do the math on that, and you'll see that it really is a big slowdown.

69
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.750
Speaker B:   And not just a slowdown. But if I'm hearing you, it's also frustrating, because you'd really like to move forward. But you're like having to wait for that feedback. Is that correct?

70
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.590
Speaker A:   Absolutely.

71
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.100
Speaker A:   It's also

72
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:13.310
Speaker A:   not very valuable. I think the concept of a code review. It's not very valuable to me. Concept of go code review is that sort of like. The more senior guy is giving the more junior guy some like

73
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.909
Speaker A:   tips and tricks, and like making sure that

74
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.360
Speaker A:   you're not going way off the the way off the trail

75
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.429
Speaker A:   right in in this project. I don't.

76
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.509
Speaker A:   I don't need any help, I don't. And the the

77
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.969
Speaker A:   once or twice. The feedback was sort of interesting, and maybe like a tiny bit valuable. But

78
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.289
Speaker A:   there's nothing that is valuable enough to justify the slowdowns.

79
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.489
Speaker B:   I got it.

80
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.049
Speaker B:   Let's let's drill into this a little bit. Have you? Did you talk to that? That technical lead about this situation and

81
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.829
Speaker B:   the consequence on the team, and the consequence on your productivity.

82
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.860
Speaker A:   Yes, yes, I complained to him about it.

83
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.559
Speaker A:   In fact, I complained to him.

84
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.419
Speaker A:   this is sort of a weird

85
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.909
Speaker A:   issue. I I complained about it to him. He didn't really change his ways.

86
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.449
Speaker A:   I complained about it to my manager.

87
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.611
Speaker A:   she at some point, I mean she sort of agrees that the projects taking too long, it's not going fast enough. So so this is a real issue.

88
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.656
Speaker A:   I mean, it's not just me that feels this way.

89
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.720
Speaker A:   At 1 point she sort of gave me a green light to say, you know.

90
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.439
Speaker A:   just get just get radical. Who's another colleague of ours to give you a thumbs up on the code review and then just publish it.

91
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.430
Speaker A:   But then the Tech Lead Guide came in and made a big stink. So it was a big.

92
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.270
Speaker A:   you know, not like a serious confrontation.

93
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.110
Speaker B:   Yeah.

94
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.900
Speaker A:   But an unpleasant disagreement.

95
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.040
Speaker B:   I gotcha.

96
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.999
Speaker A:   So he definitely knows.

97
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.330
Speaker A:   I'm not sure if you're familiar with this.

98
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.359
Speaker A:   This probably is unique to Linkedin, but

99
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:20.730
Speaker A:   he feels so so, Linkedin. There's this whole evaluation scheme for how they promote people. He feels that it's it's important for his promotion efforts

100
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.919
Speaker A:   to leave these reviews so like.

101
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.080
Speaker B:   I see.

102
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.640
Speaker A:   Like looking at the code, analyzing something that might be wrong.

103
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.039
Speaker A:   because it's sort of a paper trail in the sense that.

104
00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:33.599
Speaker B:   Yup!

105
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.299
Speaker A:   It produces an artifact.

106
00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.219
Speaker B:   Right.

107
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.699
Speaker A:   Viewed by other people and say, like, okay.

108
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.030
Speaker A:   this guy gives a lot of good code reviews. So he must be.

109
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.010
Speaker B:   Sure.

110
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.409
Speaker A:   Promotion, worthy.

111
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.440
Speaker B:   Sure. Sure.

112
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.089
Speaker B:   No, that makes total sense. Well, let let's drill into this one. And then you. I also asked for 2 or 3 others.

113
00:08:52.140 --> 00:09:07.849
Speaker B:   but in our hour together let's start here, and then we'll we'll get out of the details here and go to the other couple just to make sure we cover at least a few of your barriers on this one. I'm wondering aloud, have you? Have you thought about it? Not just complaining, but also suggesting new things he could do

114
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:28.000
Speaker B:   that would also get at the fact that you're pointing out. He wants to get promoted to. He wants to look good, so it'd be better for him to give good code reviews in a more timely fashion. Maybe he's got constraints himself, or he's busy with other stuff. But is there a way you could off? You could suggest new things he could do that would kind of get his needs met and yours.

115
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.789
Speaker B:   And if so, what what could those be? What's like? Some action he could start to take, that he hasn't been doing, or that you could do together.

116
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:39.910
Speaker B:   That would be constructive, going forward without referring to the past.

117
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:46.859
Speaker A:   Right? Yeah, that's a good idea. It it I haven't thought of that.

118
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.059
Speaker B:   Well, what? Just 1 1 idea, what? What's 1 thing he could do

119
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:59.429
Speaker B:   like, for example, could he? If you're that quick consistently with writing code. Could you have a check in every other day? Type of thing?

120
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:13.260
Speaker B:   Or is that too much like I'm not trying to over engineer it here for you, but that could be an example where it's like a new thing you could do together, gets his needs met, gets your needs met without without telling him he did a crappy job in the past. You know what I mean.

121
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.100
Speaker A:   I I mean another. Another part of the issues that are at play here is that he's kind of over scheduled.

122
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.130
Speaker B:   Okay.

123
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.300
Speaker A:   So I it. It might be a difficult to get on his calendar. We we also have

124
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.310
Speaker A:   bi-weekly. We have 2 sync meetings a week.

125
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.258
Speaker B:   That's with the team. So it's not just him and me. But it's with the team.

126
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:52.059
Speaker A:   But yeah, I mean, I could. I could try to potentially schedule a regular code code check-in session.

127
00:10:52.220 --> 00:11:10.919
Speaker B:   Or or maybe, is there a way to do it asynchronously? So you don't have to book time with him, but he has, like a tickler at like 4 45 at the end of every other day. How long does it take for him to look at code on average? And what's the range of time. Is it 15Â min to an hour, or what? What's the typical code review on his in terms of his time?

128
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.570
Speaker A:   I actually.

129
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.809
Speaker A:   So I don't know how much

130
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.706
Speaker A:   of his time it's taking. I I only know how long I wait.

131
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:38.659
Speaker B:   Sure. Obviously, I'm just saying if you could speculate and maybe maybe give it some thought. Maybe after this coaching, maybe that's some homework you could think about what new actions he could start to take, you know not wouldn't be threatening to him, would meet his needs and yours. I'm just brainstorming with you some options

132
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:56.339
Speaker B:   like, if you think, if if you think it only takes them 15Â min on average, then say every other day, could you just put a note on your calendar for yourself to look at my code and give email me some feedback. That kind of thing. Or is that is that counter cultural? Does? Does the feedback review have to be live synchronous.

133
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.930
Speaker B:   traditionally, Linkedin.

134
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.560
Speaker A:   But no, it did. It doesn't. It's supposed to be asynchronous. Yeah.

135
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.090
Speaker B:   Oh, okay, well, then.

136
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.949
Speaker B:   So that's a little bit more flexible for him, right if he can.

137
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.080
Speaker B:   Is that something? I I mean, would that be something you'd be comfortable asking him for, like a tip

138
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.649
Speaker B:   self to remind you that you're so productive that

139
00:12:14.226 --> 00:12:21.410
Speaker B:   maybe it's every 3rd day. Maybe it's not every other day, but some time frame which gets you a safety valve. You're not frustrated, you know.

140
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.460
Speaker A:   Right.

141
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.809
Speaker B:   If he commits to it then, and he's got a reminder on his calendar, he's more likely to follow through.

142
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.149
Speaker A:   Right? Yeah, that that's a good idea. I'll I'll raise it with him and see if

143
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.820
Speaker A:   if if that would work into a schedule.

144
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:44.989
Speaker B:   And how about the same question on that manager? It sounded like the manager you complain, but maybe I mean, typically managers supposed to remove barriers for people right? And so

145
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.630
Speaker B:   is there a new action the manager could do

146
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.100
Speaker B:   that would better support you here, too.

147
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:50.980
Speaker A:   Yeah.

148
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.670
Speaker A:   In addition to I mean she she tried to support me already by kind of

149
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.050
Speaker A:   you know, having having my other coworker

150
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.530
Speaker A:   giving a green light to the other coworker to.

151
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.380
Speaker B:   Sure.

152
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.800
Speaker A:   Improve the code reviews.

153
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:20.090
Speaker B:   Sure. But then that sounded if I heard you correctly. That sounded like it irritated your technical lead, because now he feels like he's getting.

154
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.710
Speaker A:   Yep.

155
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:34.419
Speaker B:   He's getting or he's not getting the advancement he wants, because it's kind of undermining him. So I'm just wondering if there's another. Is there another creative action that wouldn't threaten your technical lead? That would be supportive like

156
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.889
Speaker B:   if if

157
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:52.150
Speaker B:   if your technical lead starts to do this asynchronous thing with his tickler that you praise him behind his back to her, that she says something positive to him about it, for example, that she that she's heard good things about him being more timely, or something like that.

158
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.540
Speaker A:   Yeah, that's that's a good idea of of having them sort of.

159
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.579
Speaker A:   But I guess, helping him feel better

160
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.189
Speaker A:   and helping us get more work done.

161
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.500
Speaker A:   Okay, what else? I'll ask her.

162
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.629
Speaker B:   Something else. Maybe there's something else that I don't know your manager at all. Is there something else your manager could do that would make

163
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:26.049
Speaker B:   would boost your career, maybe not specific to your technically, but some other barrier, because it sounds like there's more noise than just your technical lead here. That might be a barrier to the project. Is that fair.

164
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.470
Speaker A:   Yeah, it does.

165
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.193
Speaker A:   There's many.

166
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:37.709
Speaker B:   Okay, what? What are some other ones? Maybe you can tell me what the other ones are, and then we'll revisit your manager and new things she might be able to do to support you.

167
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.490
Speaker A:   Yeah.

168
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:47.149
Speaker A:   So one big issue is that we're the the project is basically

169
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:55.880
Speaker A:   the goal of the project is to take an old decrepit system that somebody wrote 5 years ago

170
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:02.640
Speaker A:   or more, and works on this old platform that is now unmaintained and nobody

171
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.080
Speaker A:   it's it's like basically dying because it's not maintained.

172
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.209
Speaker A:   So take that old system and port it to a new system, which is

173
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.610
Speaker A:   the new hot. You know the new fad, the new fashion.

174
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.930
Speaker A:   you know, makes sense on paper. The issue is that

175
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.769
Speaker A:   this new platform is not fully baked.

176
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:37.420
Speaker A:   So there, you know, it's it's they're billing it. It's moving forward.

177
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.990
Speaker A:   But there's still a lot of glitches and

178
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.745
Speaker A:   shortcomings of this of this new system.

179
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:57.290
Speaker A:   I don't. I don't know that that one probably is not something where you can really help me that much, because it's

180
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.980
Speaker A:   it just is what it

181
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:07.649
Speaker A:   I mean. Maybe you can help me like how to negotiate with the the partner team. I I don't know. I I this might just be like a intrinsic technical limitation.

182
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.040
Speaker B:   Well, say say more about it sounds like it's buggy. It sounds like it's

183
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:20.960
Speaker B:   in Alpha or Beta. It's not as mature as the older system. But there's some reason the company's moving to the new system. Is that correct?

184
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:28.140
Speaker B:   I mean, is there? Is it got better performance? It's more. It's more auto scaling, I mean, what? What's unique about the new platform.

185
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:34.920
Speaker A:   It's more of a self service model where?

186
00:16:36.114 --> 00:16:39.939
Speaker A:   You know, there's this whole search. There's a search in for a team.

187
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.359
Speaker A:   So if you want to do a search project.

188
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:51.222
Speaker A:   You have to work with a search in for teams to like, get enough hardware, get enough resources.

189
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.300
Speaker B:   Yep.

190
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.890
Speaker A:   This new model. It's more like a self service where we don't have to like.

191
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.620
Speaker A:   Go to lots of meetings and like

192
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.920
Speaker A:   coordinate with them closely, but we can just like

193
00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.730
Speaker A:   users like an Admin panel, and say, like, I need 10 machines. I need.

194
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.420
Speaker B:   Nice.

195
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.599
Speaker A:   Ladimentary.

196
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.970
Speaker B:   Yes, that's on me.

197
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.829
Speaker B:   I got it. That makes sense.

198
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:23.320
Speaker B:   So it sounds more empowering. If I were you. That sounds more empowering. I have to go dink around with a bunch of meetings. I can just get the resources I need to do my work. Is that accurate.

199
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.999
Speaker A:   That's right. Yeah, again, on paper. In theory, it's a good idea.

200
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.209
Speaker B:   Okay, what? What are the glitches? What are the disconnects.

201
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:43.409
Speaker A:   So one issue is that they changed certain technical

202
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.450
Speaker A:   details in a way that makes it

203
00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:54.419
Speaker A:   in in a way that makes it difficult to port the old system. So there's a big code base

204
00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.339
Speaker A:   for the old system. The new system does roughly similar thing

205
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.520
Speaker A:   with a better, I guess. User interface in some sense.

206
00:18:03.896 --> 00:18:10.830
Speaker A:   So we just want to take this old code base and move it onto this new system. So in theory, like, it doesn't seem that hard, right?

207
00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:14.979
Speaker A:   But they made some weird technical decisions

208
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:22.110
Speaker A:   that that turns out now it is hard, or it's not as easy, as easy as it should be.

209
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.150
Speaker A:   Okay.

210
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.130
Speaker A:   there's another issue about

211
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.769
Speaker A:   you know. Linkedin loves to have Linkedin loves to have all of these

212
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:48.239
Speaker A:   tools sort of like trying to play nice with each other. So there's a whole, there's a whole Linkedin machine learning framework.

213
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:55.190
Speaker A:   And these search people want to like have that framework supported natively on their thing.

214
00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:05.920
Speaker A:   which again on paper, sounds nice, but in reality it's like a whole. The the machine learning framework is a little bit half baked. So the search people are trying to onboard this half baked

215
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.020
Speaker A:   thing.

216
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:19.979
Speaker B:   And that that makes sense. What is, what is the consequence of that complexity in that less than ideal situation on you and your work and your frustration about your own career.

217
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.780
Speaker B:   like, where? How is it? A barrier or a bottleneck, or a constraint to you and your career goals.

218
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.670
Speaker A:   So in in my mind

219
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:36.165
Speaker A:   to to get to the next career point, I need to deliver this project, you know. Make it make it successful.

220
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:46.039
Speaker A:   this project requires, you know, this new platform to work properly. Among others.

221
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.569
Speaker B:   It's not working properly.

222
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.420
Speaker A:   Not working properly. That's right.

223
00:19:50.160 --> 00:20:01.290
Speaker B:   Is there something? What would it? What would it take to get it there? Is it more resources of other departments that you're not in? Is there? What has to happen to get it? To work properly?

224
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:13.999
Speaker A:   So. So I think there a big, a big hurdle for them is they have to.

225
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:21.050
Speaker A:   They feel that they. They are feeling feeling pressure on their side to onboard all of these again. Strange Linkedin

226
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.579
Speaker A:   frameworks. If they didn't have to do that they'd be a lot closer. I think.

227
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.140
Speaker B:   Okay.

228
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.450
Speaker A:   Would be simpler.

229
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.340
Speaker B:   Okay.

230
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:40.580
Speaker A:   So maybe we could figure out a way to, you know again, maneuver organizationally, so that they

231
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.640
Speaker A:   have the option of giving us a product. That

232
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.989
Speaker A:   does what we need, but doesn't do. The full set of.

233
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.810
Speaker B:   Right.

234
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.370
Speaker A:   Features.

235
00:20:50.370 --> 00:21:04.310
Speaker B:   Yeah, I like that. That makes a lot of sense. I'm wondering aloud if that idea is something you could take to your manager and saying, Can you help make this happen? Because here's how it constrains my work. And then our collective goals. Is that is that something you could explore with her.

236
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.689
Speaker A:   I'll bring that up. I'll bring that up. That that could be.

237
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:24.920
Speaker B:   Because typically, that's the perfect example of where managers can remove barriers right? They can go get resources. They can go fight battles. You can't fight on your own, or or at least help you see political, blind spots that maybe maybe you're not even aware of there. Why, why, that cluster is the way that it is.

238
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.300
Speaker A:   Yeah.

239
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.535
Speaker B:   I don't. I don't mean cluster in the computing sense, I mean in the f sense.

240
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.513
Speaker A:   Yeah, yeah.

241
00:21:32.671 --> 00:21:47.759
Speaker B:   Okay. So we talked a bit about your technical lead and some new actions. There. We talked about your manager and some of those constraints. What is there any other barrier? Is? There is enough fallout from that, Radhika, that you need to? Is there a relationship

242
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:57.759
Speaker B:   repair that's required here on some of the fallout that's happened from the most recent past you talked about? Or is that part? Okay, it's just a blip in the radar.

243
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.010
Speaker A:   I think I mean, I think

244
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.869
Speaker A:   one issue going on here is that

245
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.769
Speaker A:   the tech lead feels a little bit threatened by me.

246
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.350
Speaker B:   Okay, because.

247
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.749
Speaker A:   Yeah, he, I think he's a guy who did a lot of code

248
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:27.549
Speaker A:   10 years ago in his previous career. Then he got promoted to a certain point, and instead of writing code, he just writes documents all day long

249
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.539
Speaker A:   and goes to meetings.

250
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.109
Speaker A:   So I think he sees me as being someone who

251
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.680
Speaker A:   like I do write code and like, I don't have any problems. I just

252
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.480
Speaker A:   get it done and send it.

253
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.930
Speaker B:   Right.

254
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.949
Speaker A:   So I think he sees me as someone's a little bit threatening in terms of all right.

255
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.060
Speaker A:   Here's this, you know, more junior guy who's like not really

256
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.020
Speaker A:   listening to my advice? Not necessarily. Whatever.

257
00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:06.329
Speaker B:   Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. What's 1 thing that your technical lead, honestly is legitimately, really good at that. You'd like to that. You either respect, or you'd like to learn.

258
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.070
Speaker B:   But he's he's maybe better than you in one area.

259
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:16.190
Speaker A:   Yeah, that's an interesting question. Definitely knows a lot.

260
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.190
Speaker B:   What's what's give me an example.

261
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.119
Speaker B:   especially of an area you'd like.

262
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.790
Speaker A:   Like to learn.

263
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.149
Speaker B:   About that. Maybe he knows more than you do.

264
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.730
Speaker A:   Yeah.

265
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:35.540
Speaker A:   Well, he he knows. I mean, he does a good job, I think, on keeping up on

266
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.509
Speaker A:   new innovations in machine learning.

267
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.270
Speaker B:   Nice.

268
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.349
Speaker B:   That. That's a struggle for most people. Isn't it? Moving area, right?

269
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:55.420
Speaker B:   Have you ever told him that you you see him as somebody very good at keeping up on things, and and how hard that can be for you at times.

270
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.480
Speaker A:   No, I I haven't. But.

271
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:17.370
Speaker B:   So just a thought that that's another new action you could consider taking again. Honestly, I'm not saying, make anything up. Praise is unique, because it can really soften whatever threat threat he may feel from you, because praise activates reciprocity and liking. And so he'll feel as long as it's sincere.

272
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:31.849
Speaker B:   And you know, and the more honest praise you give him, the less threatened he's going to feel, the deeper your relationship is going to be so. Is that something you like the next time you don't do it through email. Obviously, you want to do this in person. When's the next time you see him in person.

273
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.139
Speaker A:   I think we have a

274
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.490
Speaker A:   an event in a couple in a week or 2 I could.

275
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.899
Speaker B:   Yes, it's not inappropriate, right? You wouldn't necessarily

276
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:55.350
Speaker B:   I don't know the context of this event, but if it's 1 on one, it's appropriate sometimes, though, too, this is what I was hinting at with the How could your manager help with him? Sometimes it's better to praise people behind their backs

277
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.809
Speaker B:   right? So if.

278
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.660
Speaker A:   Interesting.

279
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.100
Speaker B:   So you can praise him to his face. That's great. But

280
00:25:00.943 --> 00:25:15.109
Speaker B:   occasionally that may be inappropriate or feels awkward, or you just don't have a chance to see him. So if he also hears praise from his manager that the manager saying, You're saying nice things about him that will soften the blows or so soften his worries about you too.

281
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.710
Speaker A:   Okay.

282
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.299
Speaker A:   Okay, yeah. I never thought about that. That's a good idea.

283
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.520
Speaker A:   No one.

284
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.089
Speaker B:   And what that means is ideally.

285
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.589
Speaker B:   you don't have to do it just right now, but you want to harvest

286
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:37.529
Speaker B:   honest examples of where he did something good or something you're impressed by, and you proactively give him this honest praise. Right? So again, it's not just a 1 off. It's like

287
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:46.330
Speaker B:   as long as it's true. I mean, if he's full of shit and you don't, you know I'm not saying make it up. But if he's really, honestly, I find it hard to keep up on machine learning stuff.

288
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.913
Speaker B:   Yeah. And

289
00:25:48.600 --> 00:26:01.920
Speaker B:   it just moves so damn fast. I don't know how anybody could be really good at that. So somebody is, I mean, that's maybe are there techniques that you might want him to teach you of how he keeps up on it in spite of his busy schedule? Or are you doing the same things? He's just really good at it?

290
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.330
Speaker B:   Or, do you know, do you know what techniques he uses to stay up to speed on it.

291
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.490
Speaker A:   Yeah, no, I don't. I don't.

292
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.150
Speaker A:   No.

293
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.600
Speaker B:   So is that something you could ask him, you know, you know, hey? I I really respect the fact that

294
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:33.409
Speaker B:   you seem to be always up to date. I find it a struggle sometimes. What's could you teach me? Your strategies? Right? So asking for advice is with Ben Franklin technique? My youngest is named Franklin, after Benjamin, so I'm quite fond of Benjamin Franklin.

295
00:26:33.753 --> 00:26:48.270
Speaker B:   I think I told you my eldest name, Feynman. I don't have any clever tricks for this coaching with Feynman, but for Franklin asking for advice, he did it back in the 17 hundreds on his worst enemy, and he borrowed a book and asked for advice, and like they became friends. So.

296
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.080
Speaker A:   Good. Yeah.

297
00:26:49.080 --> 00:27:05.970
Speaker B:   And the more it's a bit of an honor for him for him to hear you tell you. If he knows you're technically good and you're you're asking him to teach you something. Then that's that's another way. It's a kind of praise. And it's developmental for you, too, because what if he thinks of something that you hadn't thought of.

298
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:12.270
Speaker A:   And yeah, that's a good. That's a good idea, I'll say also.

299
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.930
Speaker A:   And and this is more.

300
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.679
Speaker A:   This is probably not. Now that I'm thinking about it.

301
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:24.839
Speaker A:   This is more true, this he he's he knows a lot about the Linkedin infrastructure. So so.

302
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.889
Speaker B:   That's nice. Yeah.

303
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.750
Speaker A:   Infrastructure.

304
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.719
Speaker B:   Has he had, like a much longer career at Linkedin than you have.

305
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.490
Speaker A:   Yeah, yeah.

306
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:44.249
Speaker B:   There you go. So that's another class of phrase and things he could teach you about. Maybe could could he have some unique technical insights into that complexity of this bleeding edge system. That's a bit of a constraint for everybody on your team.

307
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:44.819
Speaker A:   Oh, man!

308
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:56.179
Speaker B:   But he could. Maybe maybe he could. You could ask him for his insights about that, and you can express to him your frustration with it and ask for his technical expertise because he may have a different camera angle than you on that.

309
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.300
Speaker B:   or at least some strategies. Maybe you're not thinking about? Is that possible.

310
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.379
Speaker A:   Yeah, I I think he's also frustrated.

311
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.380
Speaker A:   Would that with the slowness of that new platform,

312
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.470
Speaker B:   He said something to you about it.

313
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.339
Speaker A:   Yeah, he's he's mentioned it in meetings.

314
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:24.975
Speaker A:   Right?

315
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:34.870
Speaker A:   It's it's this weird situation where I part part of the problem, I think, is he just doesn't have the same sense of urgency that I have.

316
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.760
Speaker B:   Oh, interesting!

317
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.770
Speaker A:   Because I.

318
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.829
Speaker B:   It would speculate. Why do you think he doesn't.

319
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.320
Speaker A:   I I guess I maybe I'm just more

320
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.859
Speaker A:   I mean, he's at a higher level, so he doesn't necessarily feel the need to get promoted soon.

321
00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.729
Speaker A:   whereas I sort of feel like

322
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.439
Speaker A:   I'm I'm wasting my time at this level, and and if I don't.

323
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:02.910
Speaker B:   Great.

324
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.760
Speaker A:   If I can't get this project.

325
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.119
Speaker A:   if I can't get promoted, then like.

326
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.629
Speaker A:   what am I even doing here?

327
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:19.659
Speaker B:   Yeah, yeah. Have you? Have you opened up to him about this about how important this is to you and how frustrating it's been to you. Does he

328
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.880
Speaker B:   have you point blank, told them this privately. Maybe.

329
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.840
Speaker A:   I guess I haven't. Now that I think about it.

330
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.190
Speaker B:   I, yeah, I, sort of.

331
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.550
Speaker A:   I assumed he would feel the same way. But maybe he doesn't. For some reason.

332
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.409
Speaker A:   I I assume you would understand that I'm frustrated that it's not moving forward fast enough.

333
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.219
Speaker B:   I would suggest, what's the harm in having a chat about it, and then asking him for his help.

334
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:53.210
Speaker B:   and you know, cause that that's a bit of a praise, but it's also it's true. And what if

335
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.840
Speaker B:   you know sometimes people that are senior to us

336
00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:03.360
Speaker B:   have a different life trajectory? Maybe he's thinking about retirement. That's why he's who knows right? If you don't know him super. Well.

337
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:11.779
Speaker B:   it's hard to know unless you're asking him, and maybe he surprises you. But again, at worst case scenario at least he knows, and you're asking for help.

338
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.749
Speaker B:   which then puts him in a senior status. It's it's respectful.

339
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:16.540
Speaker A:   Okay.

340
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.630
Speaker B:   They should feel less threatened at a minimum.

341
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.210
Speaker A:   That makes sense.

342
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.059
Speaker B:   So we talked a bit about him. We've talked about your manager. Are there other

343
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:35.420
Speaker B:   bottlenecks? Team dynamics, anything else that's getting in the way of your career.

344
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.680
Speaker B:   Trajectory.

345
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.790
Speaker A:   Let let me tell you, the other side of the

346
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.260
Speaker A:   issue. So so that was sort of on the supplier side.

347
00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.805
Speaker A:   you know, visually visualizing our team as like a a

348
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.089
Speaker A:   a middleman company that's buying something from one side and selling it to another side.

349
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.030
Speaker B:   Yeah.

350
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.029
Speaker A:   The eventual consumer of our system is the

351
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.030
Speaker A:   marketing, the the ad, basically the ads team.

352
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:15.840
Speaker A:   Okay?

353
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.700
Speaker A:   And they have a big, they have a big system

354
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:33.360
Speaker A:   which is eventually going to on on board to the tool we build to

355
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:43.070
Speaker A:   performance work. So so you know, instead of the old way they're using that's dying and nobody maintains it. They're gonna use it in this new system. We're we're doing.

356
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:51.079
Speaker A:   And then, you know, it's gonna be more maintainable and hopefully, hopefully, that actually, the performance will be better. So they will actually be able to say.

357
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.920
Speaker A:   you know, we increased our revenues by X percent.

358
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.289
Speaker A:   The problem is this, you know, this, this client team of ours?

359
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.920
Speaker A:   Th, there's a number of issues with that interface. So so one thing is that they want us to

360
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:20.329
Speaker A:   onboard their system onto our products, that so they have. They have this big code base.

361
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:29.130
Speaker A:   They will want us to tweak their code to use our tool instead of doing it themselves.

362
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.310
Speaker A:   So that's a little bit odd, because

363
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.769
Speaker A:   we don't know. We don't really know how their thing works. That's a lot of like

364
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.029
Speaker A:   technical details there that

365
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.801
Speaker A:   they know about, because they've been doing it for a long time. We don't really know about

366
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:52.130
Speaker A:   That system is also not very well maintained either.

367
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.149
Speaker A:   So one thing that happens is.

368
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.229
Speaker A:   well, it's it's very hard to test. So a number of times we've

369
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:07.130
Speaker A:   you know. I I made some changes to their product, to their code, and shipped those changes, got got it reviewed.

370
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:15.599
Speaker A:   got it reviewed, got it pushed, pushed means center production

371
00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:25.400
Speaker A:   and and it ran in production. But it blew up because, some technical, some really

372
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.130
Speaker A:   kind of embarrassing technical issue

373
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.709
Speaker A:   like in in my personal code. This kind of issue never comes up. But in Linkedin code, like, it happens all the time.

374
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.950
Speaker A:   Basically version incompatibilities between.

375
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.280
Speaker B:   I gotcha.

376
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.370
Speaker A:   Different libraries.

377
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:48.070
Speaker B:   Yep.

378
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.590
Speaker A:   So the the point is that their system is really hard to work with.

379
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.470
Speaker B:   Yep.

380
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.060
Speaker A:   It's very difficult for us to make changes to it.

381
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.370
Speaker B:   I gotcha.

382
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.080
Speaker A:   And.

383
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.690
Speaker B:   What? Why are they keen on you doing this? Then, if they've known some of that.

384
00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:09.669
Speaker A:   Yeah.

385
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.880
Speaker B:   Do you have a sense for? Why, they're asking for you to do it.

386
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.919
Speaker A:   I think they want. They they probably

387
00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:21.319
Speaker A:   feel that they don't have headcount.

388
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.639
Speaker B:   Okay.

389
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.429
Speaker A:   You know the managers are always thinking in terms of headcount, which I, which I.

390
00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:25.979
Speaker B:   Right.

391
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.300
Speaker A:   Bad concept, but.

392
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.400
Speaker B:   Yeah, yeah.

393
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.090
Speaker A:   I think their perspective is they haven't.

394
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:39.539
Speaker A:   They don't have the budget in terms of the engineering resources to make this change for us.

395
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.279
Speaker B:   I gotcha.

396
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.780
Speaker A:   So the head count has to come from our.

397
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:49.250
Speaker B:   I see I got you are there.

398
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:57.072
Speaker B:   This is typical in org design, right? The silos between departments. They're functional within and difficult to coordinate across.

399
00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:02.270
Speaker B:   Especially. And hence why, a lot of organizations are matrix. I'm wondering aloud

400
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:11.579
Speaker B:   back, you know, 15 years ago, is this idea of extreme programming where it was always done in teams is, or a hackathon type of thing. Is there a way? Is there a model that

401
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.360
Speaker B:   could get their needs met with

402
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:26.000
Speaker B:   maybe less than a full headcount that they're worried about, but gets that expertise on the quirkiness of their legacy code. And then somebody from your team, you personally or someone else?

403
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:42.399
Speaker B:   Is there something like that that you could brainstorm together with them, so that you point out some of the risks of the past and the challenges. So there's some more collaborative approach. And I'm not saying it has to be that extreme programming or hackathon thing. Is there a pair? Is there a model like that that can be explored.

404
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.699
Speaker A:   It's possible. It's possible.

405
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.440
Speaker B:   What? What are some? What are some possibilities there that that could make sense.

406
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.680
Speaker B:   that would, that would get address your concern, but would also address theirs ideally.

407
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.880
Speaker A:   So so one, yeah, it it.

408
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:10.979
Speaker A:   One stumbling block is that this is this is actually quite a quite valuable system.

409
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:17.610
Speaker A:   So nobody wants it to be offline like if it breaks, people have to jump and.

410
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.864
Speaker B:   Well, that that's why I was asking you why, like

411
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:29.339
Speaker B:   having valuable code crash has to be career shortening for most people, so are they more worried about the risk. And they're just saying, headcount.

412
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:37.439
Speaker B:   you know. Is it a political thing, or I don't want my neck in the news, or I'm gonna ex, you know. That's what I was wondering with you.

413
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.880
Speaker A:   so so it's it crashes. But it's not like

414
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.269
Speaker A:   it's a back end job. So so it runs once a day.

415
00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:00.549
Speaker A:   So if it crashes you, restart it, and then you it's not like you lose tons of money if it crashes

416
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:12.710
Speaker A:   so I don't think it's that I think it's just like really hairy, unmaintained code.

417
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.319
Speaker A:   You know, the the all these systems have this issue that once it becomes valuable, nobody.

418
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.830
Speaker A:   Everyone's too scared to

419
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:28.880
Speaker A:   change it or like improve it at all. So it gets just more like more and more tech debt. People are just making these tiny, tiny changes.

420
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.180
Speaker A:   Tech debt builds up and up. Every time you make one of these tiny changes

421
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:40.109
Speaker A:   it gets harder to maintain. It gets harder to make any future changes.

422
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.660
Speaker B:   Makes sense.

423
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:51.669
Speaker A:   So now it's to the point where it's just like a lot, even though it's a basically a small change that we're doing just like a lot of work to get there.

424
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:52.830
Speaker A:   Yeah. But so.

425
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:58.130
Speaker B:   Can I just can. I just understand that a little bit? It? It seems like part of the reasons it's it's a lot of work is.

426
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.180
Speaker B:   if you have no mental model of that history and that legacy, and

427
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:21.099
Speaker B:   then it's just like you gotta learn all that, or or hope. Hope you can notice it, whatever the quirks are versus. If you've got somebody that's worked on that for years and knows it inside and out, and maybe it's not as well documented, and but they know it super well, and then you can help work on it together. Is that is that fair?

428
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.380
Speaker B:   In terms of would that would that partially address those risks?

429
00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.590
Speaker A:   So I think it'd be much more efficient if

430
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.370
Speaker A:   they they actually had the responsibility for onboarding

431
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.690
Speaker A:   onboarding our code in in their code base.

432
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.760
Speaker B:   Is there a is there a support function, though, that you could play?

433
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.899
Speaker B:   Yeah, like, Oh, yeah.

434
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.870
Speaker A:   I mean I would I would be happy to do that.

435
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.010
Speaker A:   But but it's again. It just comes back to this issue of the headcount like they they.

436
00:38:53.010 --> 00:39:00.459
Speaker B:   Sure I got it. So that's where I'm wondering allowed with new new actions for your manager. Is this something you could explore with your manager to say, look.

437
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:06.250
Speaker B:   it would reduce the risks, you know, all around, because it's super hard for

438
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.020
Speaker B:   us to wrap our head around low, you know.

439
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.349
Speaker B:   buggy code or code that's legacy, and it's not well documented, and I don't know it. Well.

440
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:27.739
Speaker B:   it seems like it's less risky for the entire company. If we do it jointly, and this is the proposal I make, and see what she says, and see if she can help champion it with you. So it's not. You're not alone, right? You like you'd have a chorus of people

441
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.199
Speaker B:   working on that that improved approach.

442
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.840
Speaker B:   Presumably she's not gonna like delays in the project, either

443
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.569
Speaker B:   is she? Is she frustrated or worried about the same things you're worried about on this.

444
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.880
Speaker A:   She's frustrated and annoyed, but she has

445
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.620
Speaker A:   tons of other things to worry about. So it's it's a small fraction of her total.

446
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.250
Speaker B:   Okay.

447
00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.869
Speaker B:   but she'd rather not have headaches here. I mean it is again, is it? Is it too small for her to to

448
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.560
Speaker B:   help? You have a kind like.

449
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:16.170
Speaker B:   Would it be useful if she were convinced, and you could convince her to have a meeting or 2 with those other folks to talk about some alternative approach, and you arm her with a couple of options. So it's not a lot of work for her.

450
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.120
Speaker A:   Yeah.

451
00:40:18.574 --> 00:40:21.920
Speaker A:   That that is a good idea. I I will say that

452
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.930
Speaker A:   the project, the initial negotiations for the project were not.

453
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:32.280
Speaker A:   She was not involved. So so is the the tech lead that I've been bellyaching about

454
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.369
Speaker A:   was negotiating with this client team.

455
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.799
Speaker A:   and sort of persuaded them that this was a good strategy.

456
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.659
Speaker A:   So so she doesn't have a lot of context in this project. But

457
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:53.100
Speaker A:   but it's still a good potential option for seeing if we can get some additional support.

458
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:54.220
Speaker B:   Nice.

459
00:40:54.350 --> 00:41:10.419
Speaker B:   Well, let's see, we're we've got a few more minutes left in our hour together. We've talked a bit about the technical lead and some possible actions you could take there your manager. And now this new, this other department, and some of the constraints there, if, as you step back from all of it. Do you have a mentor?

460
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.919
Speaker B:   I'm not talking about our relationship as a coach. But do you have a mentor.

461
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.480
Speaker A:   Yep.

462
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.500
Speaker B:   And if so, can you tell me about him or her.

463
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:26.650
Speaker A:   Yeah, I I at 1 point had a mentor. Linkedin is very big on mentoring. They want people to mentor and be mentored.

464
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.380
Speaker B:   Yeah.

465
00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:32.350
Speaker A:   I met I met with him for about 6 months.

466
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.350
Speaker B:   Okay.

467
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:39.009
Speaker A:   He was fine. I I don't necessarily.

468
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.390
Speaker A:   I guess what I should have

469
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.420
Speaker A:   conferred with them more about is

470
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:56.859
Speaker A:   sort of like these questions that we've been discussing in terms of like, how to manage relationships, how to

471
00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:01.120
Speaker A:   navigate political disagreements.

472
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:10.960
Speaker A:   But but my mental model of that relationship was more like a technical experience.

473
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.520
Speaker B:   Sure.

474
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.470
Speaker A:   Which I didn't.

475
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.419
Speaker A:   I didn't find that very useful.

476
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:21.209
Speaker B:   Sure. Sure. Well, I'm just wondering. Is is this person someone?

477
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.969
Speaker B:   That's that's been at Linkedin for years before you are they?

478
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:33.179
Speaker B:   Are they politically connected enough to know some of the the cultural constraints or some of the political winds that may shift around.

479
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:39.240
Speaker A:   And I don't think he he's probably been there a couple of years longer than me.

480
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.020
Speaker B:   Okay.

481
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.550
Speaker A:   But not like forever.

482
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.230
Speaker B:   Okay.

483
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.080
Speaker A:   Let me! Let me!

484
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.320
Speaker B:   Just yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

485
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.510
Speaker A:   I guess they thought he would be a good mentor, because he was able to

486
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:56.100
Speaker A:   get a pretty big project completed.

487
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.540
Speaker A:   and as a result got promoted. So like.

488
00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.150
Speaker B:   Nice.

489
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.289
Speaker A:   We're successful at what I'm trying to do.

490
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:10.620
Speaker B:   But I just wanted to explore this a bit further with you. There's nothing that says. You only have to have one mentor, and maybe he was fine for what he was at the time you had him.

491
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:34.230
Speaker B:   I'm just wondering. Can you think of somebody you respect? Maybe they're something like you might want to be in the future right there. They've they've had their maybe multiple promotions. They've been there a long time. They're they're credible with the powerful people at Linkedin that you could just buy them a coffee, or say, can I meet with you once every other month or something? Would you mind mentoring me, and then.

492
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:41.469
Speaker B:   ideally, this is not in your chain of command, right? Ideally. It's like a safe place where you could open up because they might.

493
00:43:41.680 --> 00:44:08.929
Speaker B:   if you, if you were to find some one or 2 people like this doesn't have to be just one person, but one or 2 people, they might give you political perspective. I couldn't possibly right, because I just don't know Linkedin well enough. Is that, can you? You have to tell me their name? But can you think of one or 2 people that might be? They're just like you, career wise. Maybe they've also got a Phd in computer science. They've had a couple of successes. They've got the ear of very powerful people, and so they're they've been there long enough. They've got a different mental model than you on the political scene.

494
00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.619
Speaker A:   Yeah, that's a good idea. I I would have to think about I

495
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:18.359
Speaker A:   who, you know, I'd have to study the arc org charts a little bit and say, like, Okay, who?

496
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.170
Speaker B:   Yeah.

497
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.570
Speaker A:   Around who's done this? But yeah, it's good.

498
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.409
Speaker A:   Do you think I mean, do you think they would be willing to do that?

499
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:41.799
Speaker B:   Usually I mean again back to honest praise. Right? You. You find things you honestly, genuinely want to learn from them. You praise them for it, or even better, does your manager know them? Could she make an intro.

500
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.520
Speaker A:   Right.

501
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:48.690
Speaker B:   You know. Say, I'm looking for a mentor. Could you make this introduction or so, or the technical lead, you know same thing?

502
00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:50.700
Speaker A:   Yeah, that's a good idea.

503
00:44:50.700 --> 00:45:00.110
Speaker B:   But but here's the other angle. It doesn't have to be somebody currently at Linkedin. Maybe they recently retired. Maybe they're they used to work at Linkedin, and now, like

504
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.880
Speaker B:   they don't even have to have been at Linkedin, if they're like quite savvy with

505
00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:10.859
Speaker B:   corporate politics and stuff, and they can tell you how they finesse this type stuff.

506
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:21.210
Speaker B:   but I think it's better if it's if Linkedin is quite quirky or I don't know. Is it quite distinct from Microsoft's culture? Or is Microsoft's culture and Linkedin blurred together

507
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.760
Speaker B:   these days.

508
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.450
Speaker A:   Microsoft does not control Linkedin.

509
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:28.220
Speaker B:   Okay.

510
00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.930
Speaker A:   Closely.

511
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.550
Speaker B:   I got you so it'd be better

512
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:40.379
Speaker B:   for whatever quirks Linkedin has, and whatever power players, if you could get the inside track. But if you can't find that person currently employed by Linkedin.

513
00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.769
Speaker B:   somebody that recently retired, or.

514
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:50.039
Speaker B:   you know, recently went somewhere else. But but use but knows the players at Linkedin within the last take, say, 2 years.

515
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.070
Speaker A:   Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

516
00:45:54.590 --> 00:46:02.569
Speaker A:   I I guess this is I. And and other people have told me I should try to get get over this. I have this sort of reluctance to ask people for help

517
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.179
Speaker A:   in the sense that.

518
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.679
Speaker B:   I hear you.

519
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.619
Speaker A:   If I'm asking someone to mentor me like, what does he get out of it as a.

520
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:16.119
Speaker B:   Well, so that's fair. There's a concept called reverse mentoring, too.

521
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:31.500
Speaker B:   Now, some of the people like you, you pointed correctly out that that technical lead hasn't really written code in a while. Does he really know the latest on Llms? Does he really? Does he feel strong on prompt engineering right now I'll tell you the former.

522
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:47.729
Speaker B:   the the founder of Infosys. That was my mentor. When I was at emphasys, he would, he would insist on only having 2122 year old computer scientists as his as his interns, because he was like, you know, he's

523
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:53.840
Speaker B:   in his sixties. So he was quite far away from that, and he felt like he learned a lot about how

524
00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:11.389
Speaker B:   their their styles and stuff like that. And of course, as chairman or he's he's, I think he called himself Chief Mentor. He wasn't even chairman anymore. Right? He was kind of retired. He was so far out of that world. So you know, that's something you could offer him on the latest stuff.

525
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:21.960
Speaker B:   But just buy them lunch, I mean in mentors I've had in the past with my last company I would buy my mentor lunch once once every month or so

526
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:27.639
Speaker B:   at their at a restaurant they like to go to, or something like that. So even if they don't want to learn anything from you but

527
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:53.140
Speaker B:   you don't have to have just one. Generally people find back to the Ben Franklin right? He asked for advice. He asked to borrow things from an enemy. Then they became friends. So in general, asking for advice is an honor because you respect them and their point of view. And if you, said Linkedin already has a mentoring culture, that's only it should be expected that they should be mentoring. And

528
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.320
Speaker B:   yeah.

529
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:54.920
Speaker A:   Yeah, it's good. Point.

530
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.950
Speaker B:   Yeah. And if if your managers

531
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.650
Speaker B:   vouching for you as somebody that's not gonna waste their time, that doesn't hurt you either.

532
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.780
Speaker A:   Right? Right?

533
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.440
Speaker A:   Good idea. Yeah. So I'll I'll maybe I'll ask my man, my manager, to suggest someone who could.

534
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.370
Speaker A:   Sure, sure, strategic choice.

535
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.209
Speaker B:   Yeah, we've we've got just a couple of minutes left in our hour together. What?

536
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:34.929
Speaker B:   Let's just talk about some of the next steps we talked about a lot of possibilities, both for that technical lead for your manager, for that other, that other function that was tricky to work with with. And then the mentoring stuff. Wh, which of those sound like the most practical and useful for you in terms of what you want to do next to kinda

537
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.300
Speaker B:   address this.

538
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.819
Speaker A:   Well, I think you know, asking my manager

539
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:49.100
Speaker A:   there's there's a couple of things to ask my manager. One is to potentially recommend a mentor.

540
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:56.280
Speaker A:   Another is to try to

541
00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:01.020
Speaker A:   convince the client team to add some of their own resources to this project.

542
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.000
Speaker B:   Yep.

543
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:14.330
Speaker A:   And then, as far as the tech lead goes, I think it's more about trying to communicate to him

544
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:22.780
Speaker A:   in a way that's clear, but also respectful that you know I'm frustrated.

545
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.500
Speaker A:   I want to move the project faster.

546
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:32.009
Speaker A:   I want to brainstorm ways. We can clear out these roadblocks.

547
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.379
Speaker B:   Yeah, I think those would be good, I think, telling them that. And then

548
00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:48.569
Speaker B:   maybe before that, was there any of that honest praise. We talked about that that you feel like you could say early. Maybe, before you talk about the complaints and the frustrations.

549
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.970
Speaker A:   Sure. Yeah. So I'll say, you know, I respect

550
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.570
Speaker A:   your knowledge of all these Linkedin search technologies.

551
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:07.030
Speaker A:   Clearly, clearly, you know more about what's going on in like the internals of those tools?

552
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:14.380
Speaker A:   You know. Can can you? Can you teach me a little bit more about it?

553
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.599
Speaker A:   Maybe with an eye towards moving the project faster.

554
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:30.959
Speaker B:   Yeah, I like that. I like that. And then maybe just after that, maybe turn your concern and your complaint into a question. Are you as frustrated technical lead as I am on the following.

555
00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:35.499
Speaker B:   yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, I, and and maybe just express your

556
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:43.790
Speaker B:   you get, you know, you'd like to see him be successful, just like you want to be here. I'm wondering aloud, too, if you can ask him and or your manager

557
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:51.359
Speaker B:   about that promotion and what it would take if if it's mostly interesting work.

558
00:50:52.270 --> 00:51:04.630
Speaker B:   ask them what that looks like. Typically like you have one mental model, but it'd be good to get theirs, because, like I'll just tell you, in my case, every promotion I ever got I pretty much was already doing the damn job.

559
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:12.270
Speaker B:   and I didn't get permission. I like I just did it, and I did a good job, and they're like Duh. Of course he should be doing that, so I'm wondering aloud if

560
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:41.300
Speaker B:   sometimes, you know, there's an emergency project here or a special project there that either a technical lead or a manager might know about and give you. And and if it's visible that could only be better to get you that more influence that you're looking for technically is that is that a question you could ask them both. Possibly that. So so you're challenging your own understanding of what the promotion even looks like. If you know there's the the stupid typical Hr rules, but the reality might be quite different than that. Is that possible?

561
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.500
Speaker A:   Yeah, I think you know, Linkedin does instruct everyone

562
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.339
Speaker A:   to talk to their managers about career growth.

563
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.729
Speaker A:   Yeah, I I'll ask them

564
00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.010
Speaker A:   more about that and and see if I can get a clearer picture. I I think that

565
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.830
Speaker A:   yeah, it's always a little bit tricky asking those kinds of questions, or a little bit sensitive.

566
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.940
Speaker B:   That's fair. So I mean another way around it. To make sure it's not sensitive is.

567
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:24.159
Speaker B:   if you notice something creative that would be really related to their goals or your shared goals. But nobody's brought it up volunteering to do it

568
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:29.370
Speaker B:   right. That that's another angle. Because then you're an innovator. You're a problem solver

569
00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.259
Speaker B:   again. As long as it's aligned with your shared goals

570
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:37.329
Speaker B:   they should at least be willing to talk about it. And even better. What if you get to lead that thing.

571
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.450
Speaker A:   Yeah, that's that's a good idea.

572
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:57.230
Speaker B:   Most of the patents I did. I didn't get go ask permission, especially not in Hr. Right? But as a techno geeky psychologist I just did it. And of course, then I became a real weirdo.

573
00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:08.980
Speaker B:   You know, in Hr. How many Hr. People do you know that have a bunch of patents right? Not none that I know other than me. It's the same thing with you, right? If you've got all these technical skills and you're creative, and you want to get ahead.

574
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.989
Speaker B:   putting your creative problem, solving on their wicked problems in ways that they haven't considered

575
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:22.640
Speaker B:   ideally, that don't take a bunch of resources that could be that could position you in a different way as an innovator.

576
00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:35.290
Speaker B:   particularly if you're in a back office right? If you're if you're in a back end. You're not like a you're a cost center. You're not a revenue center, but you're thinking in that way that could even be better.

577
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:38.650
Speaker A:   Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.999
Speaker A:   Sounds good. Matt.

579
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.290
Speaker B:   Let's let's talk about next next coaching session. Does.

580
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.780
Speaker A:   Yes.

581
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:55.380
Speaker B:   We'll we'll certainly revisit this. Are there any other goals that you're you're you're thinking about, that we might talk about in our next coaching session. After we reflect on how these these actions went.

582
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:04.339
Speaker A:   I I want to do more work with Llms.

583
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:12.560
Speaker A:   There. There's a little bit of chatter at Linkedin about Llms, but not as still. Still, not

584
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.629
Speaker A:   a lot, you know. It's not.

585
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.350
Speaker B:   Because why not?

586
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.710
Speaker A:   they they.

587
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.150
Speaker A:   So there's a big price issue.

588
00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.000
Speaker B:   Yep.

589
00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:41.210
Speaker A:   So so we have a certain amount of quota. We get quota from Microsoft. Microsoft has the hosted.

590
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.170
Speaker B:   Sure.

591
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:43.900
Speaker A:   The stuff of the open ad

592
00:54:44.595 --> 00:54:47.680
Speaker A:   but it's but it's a pretty limited quota.

593
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.450
Speaker B:   Okay.

594
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:51.380
Speaker A:   So I'm trying to. You know, I think

595
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:56.020
Speaker A:   this is going to potentially impact a lot of different places.

596
00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:56.940
Speaker B:   Of course.

597
00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:03.760
Speaker A:   May. Maybe what I'm saying is that there's like a couple of people who have kind of been designated as Llm.

598
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.349
Speaker A:   Innovators. So they they've been.

599
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.980
Speaker A:   They've been chosen to like projects and get some quota and

600
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:19.129
Speaker A:   try to do something cool. Whereas the the rank and file hasn't hasn't really

601
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:24.039
Speaker A:   had that opportunity. So much so. So you have to sort of like maneuver a little bit. There.

602
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:49.830
Speaker B:   Gotcha I got you, but that's the kind of thing where, if you were focusing on the dependent variables, the outcomes that your manager and others are losing sleep over and finding creative ways that maybe they're not thinking of where Llm is. The de facto. Better way to solve the problem that is, is open source, completely verboten at Linkedin. Or is that is that? Is that okay? If you could make a compelling business case for it, would they allow you to use. Llama 3.

603
00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:56.059
Speaker A:   I think they would.

604
00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:01.359
Speaker A:   But so so the thing about open AI is that

605
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.719
Speaker A:   they're partners with Microsoft. We're owned by Microsoft. So there's definitely a big push towards.

606
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:10.129
Speaker B:   I get that I get that I just mean if cost is the issue, then oh, if.

607
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:14.380
Speaker A:   You know it's not the cost. It's it's really the cost of the hardware.

608
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.340
Speaker B:   I see the virtualized hardware.

609
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:18.910
Speaker A:   Yeah, yeah.

610
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:19.610
Speaker B:   Gotcha.

611
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.769
Speaker A:   That everyone's short on Gpus these days.

612
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:28.380
Speaker B:   I got it, I got it. And that's that's gonna be a problem for open source or.

613
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:29.020
Speaker A:   Yeah.

614
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:35.199
Speaker B:   Gpt, 4. Yeah, I got you good. Well, it's gonna been a good session. I look forward to

615
00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.890
Speaker B:   hearing how your your action items go. I wish you well on.

616
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:51.179
Speaker B:   and that, by the way, is called Feed forward. It's about new behaviors other people can do, and that's a lot less threatening than feedback, so err on the side of new actions as opposed to feedback on what went wrong in the past.

617
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.730
Speaker A:   Okay, I like it. I like it.

618
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:55.360
Speaker A:   Right?
